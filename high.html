<p class="first" style="margin-top: 80px;">Your results show that you exhibit many of the symptoms of depression. It is important to not use this test to self diagnose yourself with depression but it is highly reccommended that you do the following.</p>

<h2 class="w3-text-teal" style="margin-left: 50px;">Have A Support Group</h2>

<p class="first">Surrounding yourselves with other people helps you feel less depressed even when it feels more comfortable to stay isolated from others. It is important to stay connected with others, especially those who will support and care for you, like close friends and family.</p>

<h2 class="w3-text-teal" style="margin-left: 50px;">Stay Healthy</h2>

<p class="first">Exercising helps make people feel much more active and energized. Exercising with others is even better because not only are you getting your body moving, but you are also finding a way to socialize with others who will listen and support you. Eating healthy also helps with mood. Not eating enough can make you irritated and exhausted. You should also eat meals with Omega-3 fatty acids and B vitamins since they help with your mood.</p>

<h2 class="w3-text-teal"style="margin-left: 50px;">Have A Positive Attitude</h2>

<p class="first">Thoughts of failure and hopelessness can worsen depression so it is important to maintain a positive attitude. This may seem hard and even impossible but it can be done by identifiying these negative thoughts and eliminating them by looking at them through a more balanced perspective. For example, if you are having thoughts telling yourself that you are worthless, it helps to ask yourself "Is this really true? Is there any evidence that actually supports this statement?" </p>

<h2 class="w3-text-teal" style="margin-left: 50px;">Get Rest and Relax</h2>

<p class="first">When depressed, many people feel constantly tired and exhausted. That is why it is important to get at least 8 hours of sleep each day. Sleeping will also cause you to be easily irritable. Relaxation techniques, like yoga and deep breathing, can help you be less irritable.
